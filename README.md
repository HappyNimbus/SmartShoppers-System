# SmartShoppers-System

This is a GUI based project thats implements Java FX and mySQL.

SmartShoppers is a final project for a York University 3311 course which is essentially an online system for a store such as Super Store.

Users can view items, view items availability, search items by catagory, search items by name, and look for stores within a certain distance of a location(this is simulated).

Users may also add items to a cart which is saved depending on which user is signed up.

This project also features Admin and Manager GUI. Managers are able to change store closing/opening times, and add/remove/update items within their specific store.

Admins are able to do everything a manager can except on a global scale to all stores along with being able to add/remove/update managers within the system.
